# Book Tracking App - Feature Prioritization

## Executive Summary

This document prioritizes features for the Book Tracking App based on MVP requirements, user value, technical dependencies, and business impact. Features are organized into three priority levels with recommended sprint planning guidance.

---

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Must Have - MVP Critical):** Essential features required for a functional MVP. App cannot launch without these.
- **P1 (Should Have - High Value):** Important features that significantly enhance user experience and should be included in early releases.
- **P2 (Nice to Have):** Valuable enhancements that can be deferred to post-MVP releases.

---

## P0: Must Have - MVP Critical Features

*These features represent the minimum viable product. The app must have these to provide core value to users.*

### 1. US-014: Data Persistence (Story Points: 1)
**Why P0:**
- Foundation for all other features
- Without data persistence, the app has no value
- Technical prerequisite for all book management features

**Dependencies:** None (must be built first)  
**Epic:** Data Persistence  
**Sprint Recommendation:** Sprint 0/Foundation

---

### 2. US-013: View Main Screen with Both Lists (Story Points: 5)
**Why P0:**
- Core navigation and primary user interface
- Users must be able to see their books to use the app
- Foundation for all viewing features
- Provides context for all other actions

**Dependencies:** US-014 (Data Persistence)  
**Epic:** Navigation and UI  
**Sprint Recommendation:** Sprint 1

---

### 3. US-001: Add Book to Reading List (Story Points: 3)
**Why P0:**
- Primary use case: users must be able to add books
- Enables the core workflow of tracking books
- Required for MVP functionality

**Dependencies:** US-014, US-013  
**Epic:** Book Management  
**Sprint Recommendation:** Sprint 1

---

### 4. US-002: View Reading List (Story Points: 2)
**Why P0:**
- Essential for seeing what you've added
- Users need to verify their actions work
- Core viewing capability

**Dependencies:** US-001, US-013  
**Epic:** Book Management

### 5. US-005: Rate a Book (1-5 Stars) (Story Points: 2)
**Why P0:**

- Required when marking books as read
- Essential for read books functionality

**Dependencies:** US-014  
**Epic:** Rating System  
**Sprint Recommendation:** Sprint 2

---

### 6. US-003: Mark Book as Read (Story Points: 3)
**Why P0:**
- Core workflow: reading list → read books
- Primary user journey completion
- Enables tracking of completed books

**Dependencies:** US-001, US-002, US-005, US-013  
**Epic:** Book Management  
**Sprint Recommendation:** Sprint 2

---

### 7. US-007: View Read Books List (Story Points: 2)

**Sprint Recommendation:** Sprint 2

---

### 8. US-004: Add Book Directly as Read (Story Points: 3)

### 9. US-012: Navigate Between Reading List and Read Books (Story Points: 3)

- Users need navigation between key sections

**Dependencies:** US-013  
**Epic:** Navigation and UI

**Note:** May be redundant if US-013 is implemented as a single unified view. If main screen shows both lists together, this may drop to P1.

## Priority Rationale

### Why P0 Features?
1. **Data Persistence (US-014):** Without this, nothing works. Must be first.
2. **Viewing Capabilities:** Users must see their data - core value proposition.
3. **Adding Books:** Core user action - app is useless without the ability to add books.
4. **Rating System:** One of three PRD goals - essential functionality.
5. **Mark as Read Workflow:** Completes the primary user journey.
6. **Read Books View:** Core PRD goal - "track books they have read."

### Why P1 Features?
1. **Delete Functionality:** High user value, low complexity - prevents data frustration.
2. **Edit Functionality:** Essential for correcting mistakes - data quality matters.
3. **Rating Updates:** Users change opinions - improves rating system value.
4. **Book Details:** Enhances UX and provides entry point for edits.

### Why P2 Features?
1. **Advanced Features:** Add significant value but not required for MVP.
2. **Nice-to-Haves:** Can be validated after MVP based on user feedback.
3. **Future Enhancements:** Build on solid foundation established in MVP.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **US-013 (Main Screen):** Large story (5 SP) - consider breaking down if needed
- **Data Model Changes:** Ensure Room schema is flexible for future features

### Dependencies to Watch
- All features depend on US-014 (Data Persistence)
- Rating features depend on US-005
- View features depend on navigation/main screen

---

## Success Metrics (MVP)

After MVP completion, track:
- **User Retention:** % of users who return after first use
- **Books Added:** Average books per user in first week
- **Conversion Rate:** % of reading list books marked as read
- **Rating Usage:** % of read books that are rated
- **Feature Usage:** Which features are used most/least
