# Book Tracking App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to track books they have read

- Create a personal library management system
- Help users discover and organize their reading journey
- Establish a foundation for future reading insights and statistics

### Background Context

Many readers struggle to keep track of books they've read and want to remember their reading experiences. While platforms like Goodreads exist, users often want a simpler, more personal solution focused on their individual reading journey without social networking complexity.

This app fills the gap by providing a focused, streamlined experience for tracking read books with ratings and maintaining a personal reading list. The goal is to create an intuitive tool that helps readers build their personal reading library and stay motivated to read more.
