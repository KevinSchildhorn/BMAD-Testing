## Issue Resolution Summary

### Issues Encountered and Resolved
1. **CRITICAL-001:** Book entity `createdAt` timestamp bug
   - Status: ✅ **RESOLVED**
   - Resolution: Removed default value, set explicitly in repository

2. **MAJOR-001:** OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE concern
   - Status: ✅ **RESOLVED**
   - Resolution: Changed to OnConflictStrategy.ABORT

3. **MAJOR-002:** Singleton pattern race condition
   - Status: ✅ **RESOLVED**
   - Resolution: Implemented proper double-checked locking

All issues were resolved before sprint closure.

### Remaining Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
- Title validation (can be addressed in Sprint 1)
- Schema export configuration (can be addressed before production)
- Migration strategy documentation (not needed until schema changes)

---

## Knowledge Transfer

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Database Strategy:** Room database with local persistence
2. **Architecture Pattern:** Repository pattern for data abstraction
3. **Concurrency:** Flow-based reactive updates
4. **Dependency Injection:** Manual DI for MVP (can upgrade to Hilt later)

### Technical Decisions
1. **Conflict Strategy:** ABORT (prevents accidental overwrites)
2. **Singleton Pattern:** Double-checked locking for thread safety
3. **Timestamp Handling:** Explicit setting at creation time

### Lessons Learned
1. Default parameter values evaluated at class load time (important for timestamps)
2. OnConflictStrategy choice matters for data safety
3. Proper singleton implementation critical for multi-threading
4. Early QA review caught critical issues early

## Handoff to Sprint 1

### Dependencies Resolved ✅
- TICKET-001 complete and approved
- No blocking dependencies
- Foundation infrastructure ready

### Sprint 1 Readiness ✅
Sprint 1 tickets can now begin:
- **TICKET-002:** Create Main Screen with Navigation (depends on TICKET-001) ✅
- **TICKET-003:** Implement Add Book to Reading List (depends on TICKET-001) ✅
- **TICKET-004:** Display Reading List (depends on TICKET-001) ✅

All Sprint 1 tickets have their dependencies satisfied.

### Sprint 1 Recommendations
1. Use the BookRepository for all data operations
2. Follow the established architecture patterns
3. Continue comprehensive testing
4. Early QA review recommended

---

## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well ✅
1. **Clear Requirements:** Well-defined acceptance criteria enabled focused development
2. **Thorough Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage caught issues early
3. **Effective QA Process:** Early QA review identified critical issues promptly
4. **Quick Issue Resolution:** Critical and major issues fixed immediately
5. **Clean Code:** Followed best practices and architectural patterns

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Early Validation:** Could add input validation earlier (minor)
2. **Documentation:** Migration strategy documentation could be prepared (future)
3. **Schema Export:** Could enable schema export earlier (production readiness)

### Action Items for Future Sprints
1. ✅ Continue comprehensive testing approach
2. ✅ Maintain early QA review process
3. ⚠️ Add input validation earlier in development
4. ⚠️ Prepare migration strategy documentation when needed
