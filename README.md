## My Method

This project started from an Android Studio template for a Jetpack Compose app with Kotlin.
From there I installed BMAD-METHOD and took this approach:

1. Use the Product Manager to create a PRD for the app.
2. Use the Architect to design the system architecture.
3. Use the Scrum Master to create user stories.
4. Use the Product Manager to prioritize features.
5. Use the Product Owner to create development tickets from the user stories.
6. Use the Developer to implement Ticket TICKET-001: Data Persistence

## Results
During the development, BMAD creates documents located in [docs](/docs). This includes review tickets for each ticket.

## Prompts

> @pm Create a PRD for an app that tracks what books you've read and how you would rate the book from 1 to 5. Also it should have the option of a reading list, which is a list of books you want to read

created `prd.md`

```
Created Section 1: Goals and Background Context.
Rationale:
Goals align with your requirements: tracking read books, 1–5 rating, reading list
Background positions this as a simpler, more personal alternative to Goodreads
Assumption: focus on individual users (not social/sharing) for simplicity
Assumptions:
Individual user focus (no social features)
Basic rating (1–5 stars)
Simple reading list (to-read books)
```

> @architect Design the system architecture

created `architecture.md`

> @sm can you create some user stories for the book tracking app

```
Content Summary:
Technical Summary: Native Android app using MVVM, Jetpack Compose, and Room
High Level Overview: Single-activity, local-first architecture with no backend
Architecture Diagram: Mermaid diagram showing UI → ViewModel → Repository → DAO → Database flow
Architectural Patterns: MVVM, Repository Pattern, Single Source of Truth, Observer Pattern
Rationale:
MVVM: Android-recommended pattern; separates concerns; testable; works with Compose
Room Database: Type-safe ORM; local SQLite; supports Flow for reactive updates
Jetpack Compose: Already in project; declarative UI; reactive updates
Kotlin Coroutines & Flow: Handles async operations; reactive data streams
Offline-First: No backend needed for MVP; simpler architecture; better UX
Assumptions:
Mobile-only; no cloud sync in MVP
Single-user; no multi-device sync needed yet
Data fits in local SQLite (Room handles this)
Trade-offs:
Pros: Simple, offline-first, no network dependencies, fast local queries
Cons: No cloud backup, single-device only, limited scale (fine for personal use)
```
created `user-stories.md`

```
Created a user stories document for the book tracking app. It includes 14 user stories organized into 6 epics:
Book Management — adding and managing books in the reading list
Rating System — 1–5 star rating
View Read Books — viewing reading history
Book Organization — editing and deleting books
Navigation and UI — navigating between sections
Data Persistence — local storage
Each story follows the standard format:
As a [user type]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]
```
> @pm can you prioritize some features

created `feature-prioritization.md`

```
Priority structure
P0 (Must Have - MVP Critical): 8 features (19 story points)
Data Persistence (foundation)
Main Screen/Navigation
Add to Reading List
View Reading List
Rate Books (1-5 stars)
Mark Book as Read
View Read Books
Add Books Directly as Read
P1 (Should Have - High Value): 5 features (11 story points)
Delete from Reading List
Delete Read Books
Update Book Rating
Edit Book Information
View Book Details
P2 (Nice to Have): Future enhancements
Search/Filter, Statistics, Export, Reading Goals, etc.
Recommended sprint plan
Sprint 0 (Foundation): Data persistence setup - 1 SP
Sprint 1 (Core): Main screen, add books, view lists - 10 SP
Sprint 2 (Reading Workflow): Rating, mark as read, view read books - 13 SP
Sprint 3 (Organization): Delete, edit, update rating - 8 SP
Sprint 4 (Enhancement): Book details, polish - 3 SP
```

> @po can you look at the user-stories.md and create some tickets around the work

created `development-tickets.md`

```
Tickets created
Sprint 0 (Foundation):
TICKET-001: Data Persistence (1 SP)
Sprint 1 (Core):
TICKET-002: Main Screen (5 SP)
TICKET-003: Add Book to Reading List (3 SP)
TICKET-004: Display Reading List (2 SP)
Sprint 2 (Reading Workflow):

TICKET-006: Mark Book as Read (3 SP)
TICKET-007: Display Read Books List (2 SP)
TICKET-008: Add Book Directly as Read (3 SP)
TICKET-009: Navigation (3 SP)
Sprint 3 (Organization):
TICKET-010: Remove Book from Reading List (2 SP)
TICKET-011: Delete Read Book (2 SP)
TICKET-012: Update Book Rating (2 SP)
TICKET-013: Edit Book Information (2 SP)
Sprint 4 (Enhancement):
TICKET-014: Book Details Screen (3 SP)

Total: 14 tickets, 35 story points

```

> @dev can you do the work for TICKET-001

The work was done.

> @ux-expert can you create some UI for a list of books from the database

```
1. BookListViewModel (BookListViewModel.kt)
Observes books from the repository using Flow
Uses StateFlow for reactive UI updates
Manages book list state
2. BookItem Composable (BookItem.kt)
Card layout for each book
Shows book icon (different for read vs reading list)
Displays title, author, and status
Shows star ratings for read books
Visual distinction between read and unread books
3. BookListScreen Composable (BookListScreen.kt)
Material 3 TopAppBar with "My Books" title
LazyColumn for scrolling book list
Empty state with message when no books exist
Automatically updates when books are added/modified/deleted
4. MainActivity Updates
Replaced placeholder content with BookListScreen
Integrated with the existing theme
```

Note: This actually had an error from a missing icon

> @dev can you create tests for TICKET-001 

```
Test summary
Total tests: 40+ tests
Coverage: All TICKET-001 acceptance criteria verified
Flow reactive updates: Verified that Flow emits on all data changes
Ordering: Verified createdAt DESC ordering
Edge cases: Null values, empty queries, non-existent books
Error handling: Exception scenarios tested
The tests verify that:
Room database is configured correctly
Book entity has all required fields
DAO interface has complete CRUD operations
Repository pattern is implemented correctly
All data operations use Kotlin coroutines and Flow
Flow emits reactively when data changes
Data persists and orders correctly
```
> @qa can you review the code for TICKET-001

Created `qa-review-ticket-001.md`

```
Overall Status: Conditional approval
Implementation meets most acceptance criteria, but critical and major issues must be addressed.
Critical Issues Found (must fix)
Book entity createdAt timestamp bug
Location: Book.kt:24
Problem: System.currentTimeMillis() is evaluated at class load time, not instance creation
Impact: All books created in the same session get the same timestamp
Fix: Remove default value or set it explicitly in repository methods
Major Issues Found (must fix)
OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE risk
Location: BookDao.kt:50,57
Problem: Using REPLACE can overwrite existing data
Fix: Use ABORT or IGNORE for new inserts
Singleton pattern race condition
Location: BookDatabase.kt:40-50
Problem: Double-checked locking pattern is incomplete
Fix: Re-check INSTANCE inside synchronized block
Minor Issues (should fix)
Missing title validation — repository doesn't validate empty/blank titles
Schema export disabled — should be enabled for production
Missing migration documentation — future schema changes need planning
Strengths
Architecture follows best practices (Repository pattern)
Reactive updates implemented with Flow
Test coverage: 40+ tests
Documentation: Good KDoc comments
Error handling: Proper exceptions with clear messages
Test Coverage: Excellent
All CRUD operations tested
Flow reactive updates verified
Edge cases covered
Error scenarios tested
```
